# Asthma Attack Predictions based on AMHS

This repository contains the code that has been used in the study ["Application of Machine Learning to Support Self-Management of Asthma with mHealth"](https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175679)

We used the AMHS dataset to determine the key risk factors associated with asthma attacks.

If you would like to use the code, please attribute/cite it to the associated paper or this repository
